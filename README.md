# Message Board

Completed the Message Board project as part of The Odin Project's Node course.
At the '/' route, all the messages are displayed.
At the '/new' route, a form to add a new message is shown. 
Once the form is submitted, the user is redirected the the '/' route, where they can see their own messages and the messages of others, on the message board.
The app has been deployed on [Fly.io](https://message-board-demo.fly.dev/), add a '/new' at the end of the link to add a new message.
All new messages will be removed after a period of inactivity.
